## Implementation Standards

### Code Patterns
All implementations must follow the standard code patterns:
- [DATABASE_QUERY_PATTERNS.md](../multitenancy/DATABASE_QUERY_PATTERNS.md): For database interactions
- [PERMISSION_QUERY_OPTIMIZATION.md](../rbac/PERMISSION_QUERY_OPTIMIZATION.md): For permission checks
- [EVENT_CORE_PATTERNS.md](../integration/EVENT_CORE_PATTERNS.md): For event handling
- [DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](../ui/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md): For UI components

### Testing Requirements
Each implementation phase has specific testing requirements:
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests between components
- Performance testing for critical paths
- Security testing for all exposed interfaces

## Validation Checkpoints

### Phase 1 Checkpoint
- [x] Database schema correctly implements tenant isolation
- [x] Authentication system enforces tenant context
- [x] RBAC system works with tenant-scoped permissions
- [x] Security controls prevent cross-tenant access

### Phase 2 Checkpoint
- [ ] Permission checks resolve in under 50ms
- [ ] Tenant management features work correctly
- [ ] Audit logging captures all required events
- [ ] Core features tested under multi-tenant load

### Phase 3 Checkpoint
- [ ] Dashboards display correct tenant-specific data
- [ ] Security monitoring detects suspicious activity
- [ ] System meets performance targets under load
- [ ] Advanced features properly isolated between tenants

### Phase 4 Checkpoint
- [ ] Mobile experience meets design standards
- [ ] Security audit passes all requirements
- [ ] Production deployment checklist completed
- [ ] Launch readiness validated

## Alternative Approaches

> **IMPORTANT**: Only follow alternative approaches if explicitly directed by the project team. The above implementation path is the authoritative standard.

In rare cases where the standard path cannot be followed, document the deviation and rationale in the project's decision log.
