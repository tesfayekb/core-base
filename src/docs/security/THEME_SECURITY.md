# Theme Security Framework

Given the requirement for theme customization by both SuperAdmin and individual users, we need additional security measures:

## Theme Injection Prevention

1. **CSS Security**:
   - Validate all theme customization inputs
   - Sanitize CSS values to prevent injection attacks
   - Use allowlists for permitted CSS properties and values
   - Prohibit JavaScript in any theme customization field
   - CSS property filtering to prevent dangerous properties

## Theme Authorization Controls

1. **Access Controls**:
   - Enforce strict permission checks for global theme changes
   - Limit individual user customization to their own preferences
   - Prevent users from modifying themes for other users
   - Multi-party approval for global theme changes

## Theme Asset Protection

1. **Asset Security**:
   - Validate and sanitize image uploads for themes
   - Restrict file types and sizes for theme assets
   - Scan all uploaded theme assets for embedded malicious content
   - SVG content validation and sanitization

## CSS Sandbox Implementation

1. **CSS Isolation**:
   - Implement CSS scoping to prevent theme styles from affecting critical UI components
   - Use shadow DOM or similar techniques to isolate theming from security-critical UI
   - Establish CSS property allowlists for user customization
   - Theme preview security using sandbox environments

## Theme Data Isolation

1. **Data Security**:
   - Store theme customizations in dedicated tables with proper RLS policies
   - Prevent unauthorized access to other users' theme data
   - Implement rate limiting for theme change operations
   - Regularly audit theme data access

## Theme Change Auditing

1. **Audit Logging**:
   - Log all theme customization activities
   - Track SuperAdmin global theme changes
   - Record individual user theme preference changes
   - Alert on suspicious theme modification patterns

## Preview Sandboxing

1. **Secure Previews**:
   - Implement secure preview functionality for theme changes
   - Isolate theme previews from production data
   - Ensure previews can't trigger unauthorized actions
   - Use mock data to prevent information leakage
