- Continuous monitoring
- User access restoration
- Normal operations resumption

**Enhanced Monitoring:**
- Increased security monitoring
- Anomaly detection enhancement
- Performance monitoring
- User activity tracking

### Phase 4: Post-Incident Review (24-72 hours)

**Incident Documentation:**
- Complete incident timeline
- Root cause analysis
- Impact assessment
- Response effectiveness review

**Lessons Learned:**
- Response procedure evaluation
- Security control assessment
- Training needs identification
