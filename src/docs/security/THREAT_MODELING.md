# Security Threat Modeling

> **Version**: 1.1.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-05-24

## Overview

Comprehensive threat modeling approach for identifying, analyzing, and mitigating security risks within the enterprise application. This document follows industry standards including STRIDE methodology and OWASP threat modeling guidelines.

## Threat Modeling Methodology

### STRIDE Framework Implementation

The system uses the **STRIDE** threat modeling framework for comprehensive risk assessment:

- **S**poofing: Impersonating something or someone else
- **T**ampering: Modifying data or code  
- **R**epudiation: Claiming to not have performed an action
- **I**nformation disclosure: Exposing information to unauthorized individuals
- **D**enial of service: Denying or degrading service to users
- **E**levation of privilege: Gaining capabilities without proper authorization

### Threat Assessment Process

**Phase 1: System Decomposition**
1. Identify system components and data flows
2. Map trust boundaries and entry points
3. Document privilege levels and access controls
4. Catalog sensitive data and assets

**Phase 2: Threat Identification**
1. Apply STRIDE methodology to each component
2. Identify potential attack vectors
3. Document threat scenarios and attack paths
4. Assess threat likelihood and impact

**Phase 3: Risk Analysis**
1. Calculate risk scores (Likelihood × Impact)
2. Prioritize threats by risk level
3. Document existing mitigations
4. Identify residual risk

**Phase 4: Mitigation Planning**
1. Design countermeasures for high-risk threats
2. Implement security controls
3. Validate mitigation effectiveness
4. Monitor for emerging threats

## System Components Threat Analysis

### 1. Authentication System

**Trust Boundary**: External users → Authentication service

**Identified Threats:**
- **Spoofing**: Credential theft, impersonation attacks
- **Tampering**: Session hijacking, token manipulation
- **Information Disclosure**: Credential exposure, session data leakage
- **Denial of Service**: Brute force attacks, account lockouts
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Authentication bypass, privilege escalation

**Mitigations:**
- Multi-factor authentication implementation
- Strong password policies and complexity requirements
- Rate limiting and progressive delays
- Secure session management with rotation
- Account lockout policies with monitoring
- Encrypted credential storage and transmission

### 2. Authorization/RBAC System

**Trust Boundary**: Authenticated users → Permission resolution

**Identified Threats:**
- **Spoofing**: Role impersonation, permission spoofing
- **Tampering**: Permission modification, role escalation
- **Repudiation**: Unauthorized action denial
- **Information Disclosure**: Permission enumeration, role exposure
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Horizontal/vertical privilege escalation

**Mitigations:**
- Direct permission assignment model ([../RBAC_SYSTEM.md](../RBAC_SYSTEM.md))
- Entity boundary enforcement ([../rbac/ENTITY_BOUNDARIES.md](../rbac/ENTITY_BOUNDARIES.md))
- Permission dependency validation ([../rbac/PERMISSION_DEPENDENCIES.md](../rbac/PERMISSION_DEPENDENCIES.md))
- Comprehensive audit logging for all permission checks
- Regular permission reviews and validation

### 3. Multi-Tenant Data Layer

**Trust Boundary**: Application layer → Database layer

**Identified Threats:**
- **Spoofing**: Tenant impersonation, context manipulation
- **Tampering**: Cross-tenant data modification
- **Information Disclosure**: Tenant data leakage, isolation bypass
- **Denial of Service**: Resource exhaustion, tenant blocking
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Cross-tenant access escalation

**Mitigations:**
- Row-Level Security (RLS) policies ([../multitenancy/DATA_ISOLATION.md](../multitenancy/DATA_ISOLATION.md))
- Tenant context validation in all queries
- Database query pattern enforcement ([../multitenancy/DATABASE_QUERY_PATTERNS.md](../multitenancy/DATABASE_QUERY_PATTERNS.md))
- Resource quotas and monitoring per tenant
- Encrypted data at rest with tenant-specific keys

### 4. API Endpoints

**Trust Boundary**: Client applications → API gateway

**Identified Threats:**
- **Spoofing**: API key spoofing, endpoint impersonation
- **Tampering**: Parameter manipulation, request modification
- **Information Disclosure**: API enumeration, data exposure
- **Denial of Service**: API abuse, resource exhaustion
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Endpoint bypass, unauthorized access

**Mitigations:**
- Input validation and sanitization ([INPUT_VALIDATION.md](INPUT_VALIDATION.md))
- Rate limiting and throttling
- API authentication and authorization
- Request/response encryption
- Comprehensive error handling ([ERROR_HANDLING.md](ERROR_HANDLING.md))

### 5. Audit Logging System

**Trust Boundary**: System components → Audit storage

**Identified Threats:**
- **Tampering**: Log modification, audit trail corruption
- **Repudiation**: Log deletion, event denial
- **Information Disclosure**: Audit data exposure, PII leakage
- **Denial of Service**: Log flooding, storage exhaustion

**Mitigations:**
- Tamper-evident logging with cryptographic verification
- Separate audit storage with restricted access
- PII protection in audit logs ([../audit/PII_PROTECTION.md](../audit/PII_PROTECTION.md))
- Log retention and archival policies ([../audit/STORAGE_RETENTION.md](../audit/STORAGE_RETENTION.md))

## Risk Assessment Matrix

### Risk Scoring Formula
**Risk Score = Likelihood (1-5) × Impact (1-5) × Asset Value (1-3)**

### Risk Categories
- **Critical (45-75)**: Immediate action required
- **High (30-44)**: Address within 30 days
- **Medium (15-29)**: Address within 90 days  
- **Low (1-14)**: Monitor and review annually

### Top Risk Scenarios

| Threat | Component | Likelihood | Impact | Asset Value | Risk Score | Priority |
|--------|-----------|------------|---------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Cross-tenant data leakage | Multi-tenant DB | 3 | 5 | 3 | 45 | Critical |
| Privilege escalation | RBAC System | 3 | 4 | 3 | 36 | High |
| Authentication bypass | Auth System | 2 | 5 | 3 | 30 | High |
| API abuse/DoS | API Gateway | 4 | 3 | 2 | 24 | Medium |
| Audit log tampering | Audit System | 2 | 4 | 2 | 16 | Medium |
