To ensure the logging system does not impact application performance, the following strategies are implemented:

## Asynchronous Processing

- **Non-blocking log submission** using background workers
- **Deferred database writes** for non-critical logs
- **Queue-based architecture** to handle load spikes

### Implementation Details

1. **Worker Architecture**
   - Dedicated worker threads for log processing
   - Configurable thread pool size based on system load
   - Priority-based processing queue with critical logs having higher priority
   - Graceful shutdown with guaranteed log persistence

2. **Message Queue Integration**
   - In-memory buffer for immediate log capture (configurable size: 1000-10000 entries)
   - Persistent queue for system restart resilience
   - Batch processing for efficient I/O operations
   - Checkpoint system for guaranteed delivery

3. **Backpressure Handling**
   - Adaptive throttling during high load
   - Circuit breakers to prevent system overload
   - Graceful degradation with selective logging
   - Recovery strategies after overload conditions

## Selective Logging

- **Sampling high-volume events** for statistical analysis
- **Configurable verbosity** for different system components

### Configuration Framework

1. **Dynamic Configuration**
   - Runtime-adjustable logging thresholds
   - Per-module log level configuration

   - Configuration change auditing

2. **Intelligent Sampling**
   - Consistent sampling with preservation of related events
   - Weighted random sampling based on event significance
   - Adaptive sampling rates based on system load
   - Full logging of error conditions regardless of sampling

3. **Context-Aware Verbosity**
   - Session-specific debug modes for troubleshooting
   - User-specific logging for issue reproduction
   - Feature-flag integration for new feature monitoring
   - Gradual logging reduction for stable features

## Efficient Storage

- **Optimized database schema** with proper indexes

3. **Index Architecture**
   - Covering indexes for common query patterns
   - Partial indexes for high-selectivity conditions
   - Expression indexes for computed fields
