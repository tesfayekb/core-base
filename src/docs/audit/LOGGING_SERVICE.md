# Logging Service Architecture

The logging system adopts a layered approach to minimize performance impact:

## Logger Interface Layer

- Generic logging functions for different categories
- Context enrichment with user, session, and request information
- Severity level determinations based on event type
- Standardized formatting across the application
- PII minimization filtering at source
- Resource traceability via consistent URN format

## Transport Layer

- Asynchronous message queue for non-blocking operation
- Batched write operations to improve database performance
- Retry mechanism for failed log persistence
- Local buffer for offline or high-latency scenarios
- Guaranteed delivery system for critical security logs

## Storage Layer

- Efficient database schema with proper indexing
- Automatic log rotation and archiving
- Configurable retention policies by log category
- Backup strategy for critical security logs
- Tamper-evident storage with cryptographic verification

## Access Layer

- Role-based access controls for log viewing
- Granular permissions for different log categories
- Filtering and search capabilities
- API-based export functionality for compliance reporting
- Integration endpoints for SIEM systems

## Standardized Log Format

The logging system follows a standardized format:

### Common Fields

- **Timestamp**: When the event occurred
- **Level**: Severity level (info, warning, error, critical)
- **Category**: Event category (security, user_activity, system, performance)
- **User ID**: The user who performed the action
- **Action**: The specific operation performed
- **Resource Type**: The type of resource affected
- **Resource ID**: The identifier of the affected resource
- **Resource URN**: Universal Resource Name for cross-system tracing
- **Details**: Additional contextual information
- **IP Address**: Source IP address
- **User Agent**: Browser/client information

### Security Event Fields

- **Verification Hash**: Cryptographic proof of log integrity
- **Previous Record Hash**: Chain of verification for tamper detection

### Relationship Fields

- **Related Entity Type**: Type of related entity
- **Related Entity ID**: Identifier of related entity
- **Relationship Type**: How the entity relates to the log event
