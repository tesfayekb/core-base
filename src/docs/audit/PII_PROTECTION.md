# PII Protection and Security Compliance

## Data Protection Alignment

The log system implements the data protection requirements from security documentation:

## PII Minimization

- **Selective Collection**: Only necessary personally identifiable information is included in logs
- **Data Masking**: Sensitive data is masked according to security policy
- **Access Control**: PII in logs is protected by the same RBAC system as other data
- **Retention Enforcement**: PII-containing logs follow appropriate retention policies

### Minimization Strategies

1. Clear guidelines for what PII should never be logged
2. Automated PII detection and redaction
3. Configurable masking rules by data type
4. Contextual logging that adapts to data sensitivity

## PII Handling in Logs

- **Field-Level Redaction**: Specific fields containing PII are redacted
- **Pattern Recognition**: Automated detection of PII patterns
- **Contextual Awareness**: Different redaction rules for different contexts
- **Compliance Verification**: Automated scanning for PII leakage

### Implementation Techniques

1. Regex-based pattern matching for common PII formats
2. Field-specific sanitization rules
3. Configurable redaction symbols and techniques
4. Post-processing verification of redaction effectiveness

## Security Incident Response Integration

The logging system provides critical support for the security incident response procedures:

- **Evidence Preservation**: Tamper-evident logs provide forensic evidence
- **Timeline Reconstruction**: Comprehensive event logging enables accurate incident timelines
- **Attack Pattern Detection**: Log analysis helps identify security breach patterns
- **Remediation Verification**: Logs confirm the effectiveness of security measures

### Security Response Features

1. Log quarantine for security investigations
2. Extended retention for security events
3. Correlation tools for related events
4. Export capabilities for external analysis

## Compliance Framework

- **Regulatory Mapping**: Each log field is mapped to relevant regulations
- **Automated Compliance Checking**: Regular verification of compliance
- **Documentation Generation**: Automated compliance documentation
- **Audit Support**: Tooling to support compliance audits

### Compliance Coverage

1. GDPR Article 30 record keeping
2. HIPAA audit controls (if applicable)
3. PCI DSS logging requirements (if applicable)
4. SOX compliance support (if applicable)
5. Industry-specific compliance as needed
