# Phase 1: Project Foundation

> **Version**: 3.0.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-05-23

## Overview

This phase establishes the core foundation for the application. For optimal AI processing, this phase has been broken down into focused implementation guides.

## Implementation Guides

Phase 1 is now organized into 5 focused guides (50-100 lines each):

### [Phase 1.1: Project Setup](phase1/PROJECT_SETUP.md)
- Technology stack configuration
- Development environment setup
- Folder structure organization
- Build process and routing

### [Phase 1.2: Database Foundation](phase1/DATABASE_FOUNDATION.md)  
- Core database schema implementation
- Migration system setup
- Entity relationships and constraints
- Row Level Security policies

### [Phase 1.3: Authentication Implementation](phase1/AUTH_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- User registration and login flows
- JWT token management
- Password security and reset
- Session management

### [Phase 1.4: RBAC Foundation](phase1/RBAC_FOUNDATION.md)
- SuperAdmin and BasicUser roles
- Direct permission assignment model
- Permission checking service
- Entity boundaries enforcement

### [Phase 1.5: Security Infrastructure](phase1/SECURITY_INFRASTRUCTURE.md)
- Input validation and sanitization
- Security headers and communication
- Audit logging foundation
- Basic UI layout and themes

## Complete Implementation Sequence

1. **Week 1**: Project Setup → Database Foundation
2. **Week 2**: Database Foundation → Authentication Implementation  
3. **Week 3**: Authentication → RBAC Foundation
4. **Week 4**: RBAC Foundation → Security Infrastructure

## Success Criteria

At the end of Phase 1, the application should have:

1. **Working Authentication**: Users can register, login, logout
2. **Basic RBAC**: SuperAdmin and BasicUser roles with permission checking
3. **Secure Foundation**: Input validation, XSS protection, secure communication
4. **UI Layout**: Responsive layout with theme support
5. **Database**: Core schema with migrations
6. **Audit Trail**: Basic logging for authentication and permission events
