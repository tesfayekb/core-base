# Phase 3: Advanced Features and Dashboard

> **Version**: 3.0.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-05-23

## Overview

This phase implements advanced application features including comprehensive dashboards, analytics, performance optimization, advanced testing features, and security monitoring. It builds upon the solid foundation, core features, and multi-tenant infrastructure from previous phases.
