## Testing Implementation Rules

### Mandatory Testing Before Feature Completion
1. **Unit Tests**: Every function and component must have unit tests
2. **Integration Tests**: Every feature must have integration tests
3. **E2E Tests**: Critical user flows must have end-to-end tests
4. **Performance Tests**: Every feature must meet performance benchmarks
5. **Security Tests**: Every feature must pass security validation

### Testing Dependencies
- **Database tests** BEFORE **authentication tests**
- **Authentication tests** BEFORE **RBAC tests**
- **RBAC tests** BEFORE **multi-tenant tests**
- **Security tests** run in parallel with feature tests
- **Performance tests** after feature completion
- **E2E tests** after all integrations complete

### Test Data Management
- **Isolated test databases** for each testing phase
- **Transaction rollback** for all database tests
- **Test factories** for consistent data generation
- **Mock services** for external dependencies
- **Clean state** between test runs

## Validation Checkpoints

### Phase Completion Criteria
Each phase must pass all testing requirements before proceeding:

**Phase 1 Complete When:**
- All foundation features tested and passing
- Security controls verified
- Multi-tenant isolation confirmed
- Performance baselines established

**Phase 2 Complete When:**
