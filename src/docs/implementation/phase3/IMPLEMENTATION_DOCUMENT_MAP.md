# Phase 3: Advanced Features - Implementation Document Map

> **Version**: 1.0.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-05-23

## Overview

This map consolidates all documentation references needed for Phase 3 implementation, focusing on dashboards and advanced features.

## Core Implementation Documents

### Essential Reading (Phase 3 Only)
These are the ONLY documents needed for Phase 3 implementation:

#### 1. Audit Dashboard
- **[../../../audit/DASHBOARD.md](../../../audit/DASHBOARD.md)**: Dashboard implementation
- **[../../../ui/examples/TABLE_EXAMPLES.md](../../../ui/examples/TABLE_EXAMPLES.md)**: Table components

#### 2. Security Monitoring
- **[../../../security/SECURITY_MONITORING.md](../../../security/SECURITY_MONITORING.md)**: Security monitoring
- **[../../../security/SECURITY_EVENTS.md](../../../security/SECURITY_EVENTS.md)**: Security events

#### 3. Dashboard System
- **[../../../ui/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md](../../../ui/DESIGN_SYSTEM.md)**: Design system
- **[../../../ui/COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md](../../../ui/COMPONENT_ARCHITECTURE.md)**: Component architecture

#### 4. Multi-Tenant Advanced
- **[../../../multitenancy/IMPLEMENTATION_EXAMPLES.md](../../../multitenancy/IMPLEMENTATION_EXAMPLES.md)**: Implementation examples

#### 5. Testing Framework
- **[../../../TEST_FRAMEWORK.md](../../../TEST_FRAMEWORK.md)**: Testing framework
- **[../../../testing/PERFORMANCE_TESTING.md](../../../testing/PERFORMANCE_TESTING.md)**: Performance testing

#### 6. Performance Optimization
- **[../../../PERFORMANCE_STANDARDS.md](../../../PERFORMANCE_STANDARDS.md)**: Performance standards

## Critical Integration Points

### MANDATORY Prerequisites from Phase 2
- Advanced RBAC operational
- Enhanced multi-tenant features functional
- Enhanced audit logging active
- User management system operational

### Phase 3 Dependencies
- **Audit Dashboard** can start immediately
- **Security Monitoring** can run in parallel
- **Dashboard System** after design system review
- **Performance Optimization** comes last

## AI Implementation Notes

### Simplified Document Set
- Only 11 documents total for entire Phase 3
- Each guide references maximum 2-3 documents
- Focus on dashboard and visualization components

### Validation Checkpoints
- Test audit dashboard functionality
- Validate security event monitoring
- Verify dashboard responsiveness
- Test multi-tenant advanced features
- Validate performance improvements

## Success Criteria
✅ Audit dashboard operational with search and analytics  
✅ Security monitoring with real-time alerts  
✅ Admin and user dashboards functional  
✅ Advanced multi-tenant features implemented  
✅ Enhanced testing framework operational  
✅ Performance optimized across all components
