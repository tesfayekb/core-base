# Incremental Development Strategy

This document outlines the sprint-based, incremental approach to project development.

## Sprint Schedule

The project is organized into 2-week sprints with specific focus areas:

- **Sprint 1-2**: Project foundation (Setup, Authentication, RBAC)
  - Week 1: Project setup, base configuration
  - Week 2: Authentication system, initial RBAC framework
  
- **Sprint 3-4**: Core functionality (Resource Framework, API, Forms)
  - Week 3: Resource definition system, validation framework
  - Week 4: API layer, form system basics
  
- **Sprint 5-6**: Feature development (Dashboard, User Management)
  - Week 5: Admin dashboard, user management screens
  - Week 6: Role management, resource browsing
  
- **Sprint 7-8**: Polish and finalization
  - Week 7: UI refinement, performance optimization
  - Week 8: Documentation, deployment preparation

## Development Approach

### Vertical Slices

Each feature is implemented as a vertical slice through all layers:

1. Database schema changes
2. API endpoints
3. Service layer functions
4. UI components
5. Tests at each level

### Feature Flagging

New features are developed behind feature flags:

1. Features can be enabled/disabled per environment
2. Incomplete features can be merged to main branch
3. Progressive feature rollout is supported

### Continuous Integration

All code changes follow a CI workflow:

1. Automated tests on PR creation
2. Linting and code quality checks
3. Preview environment deployment
4. Manual QA verification

## Release Strategy

### Version Increments

- **Minor Version**: Every 2 sprints (monthly)
- **Major Version**: After completing all phases (or significant milestones)

### Release Preparation

Each release includes:

1. Release notes documentation
2. Migration scripts for database changes
3. Deployment verification plan
4. Rollback procedures
