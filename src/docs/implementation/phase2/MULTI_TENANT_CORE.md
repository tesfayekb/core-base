# Phase 2.2: Legacy - Multi-Tenant Core Implementation

> **Version**: 2.0.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-05-23

## ⚠️ DEPRECATED NOTICE

**This guide has been superseded by the new multi-tenant first approach.**

**New Path**: Multi-tenant capabilities are now foundational architecture implemented in **Phase 1.6: Multi-Tenant Foundation** and enhanced in **Phase 2.2: Enhanced Multi-Tenant Features**.

## Migration Notice

If you were following this guide:

1. **Stop Here**: This implementation approach is deprecated
2. **Start Fresh**: Begin with Phase 1.6 for foundational multi-tenancy
3. **Enhanced Features**: Continue to Phase 2.2 for advanced multi-tenant capabilities

## Why This Changed

The original approach of adding multi-tenancy in Phase 2 was problematic because:

- **Retrofitting Complexity**: Adding multi-tenancy to existing single-tenant code is error-prone
- **Architecture Mismatch**: Multi-tenant isolation requires foundational database and authentication changes
- **Performance Issues**: Optimizing for multi-tenancy requires ground-up design
- **Security Risks**: Tenant isolation must be built into core security model

## New Implementation Path

✅ **Phase 1.6**: [Multi-Tenant Foundation](../phase1/MULTI_TENANT_FOUNDATION.md)  
✅ **Phase 2.2**: [Enhanced Multi-Tenant Features](ENHANCED_MULTI_TENANT.md)
