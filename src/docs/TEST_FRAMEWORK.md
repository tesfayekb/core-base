   - String/date manipulation
   - Data formatting
   - Math calculations

3. **UI Components**: 75% coverage
   - Rendering tests
   - Event handling
   - Accessibility validation
   - State changes

4. **Custom Hooks**: 85% coverage
   - State management
   - Lifecycle behavior
   - Side effect handling
   - Error conditions

5. **API Services**: 90% coverage
   - Request formation
   - Response handling
   - Error handling
   - Authentication logic

6. **Form Validation**: 90% coverage
   - Field validation rules
   - Submission handling
   - Error presentation
   - Edge cases

## Test Automation Architecture

- **CI Pipeline Integration**: Automated testing approach in development workflow
- **Test Execution Strategy**: Pre-commit, PR, and scheduled testing approach
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Full test coverage execution strategy
- **Reporting Framework**: Test results collection and visualization approach

## Resource Test Integration

For comprehensive documentation on how tests are automatically generated when resources are created, see [TEST_SCAFFOLDING.md](TEST_SCAFFOLDING.md). This integration ensures:

- Automatic test scaffold generation during resource registration
- Resource-specific test scenario generation
- Test data factories customized to each resource
- Complete coverage of CRUD operations and permissions

## Test Data Management Architecture

### Database Test Data Strategy

- **Test Database Isolation**: Dedicated test database environment separate from development and production
- **Schema Synchronization**: Automated schema sync between environments using migration scripts
- **Transaction Boundaries**: All tests run within transactions that are rolled back after completion
- **Pre-Test Data Reset**: Database state reset before each test suite execution

### Test Fixtures and Factories

- **Data Factories**: Programmatic generation of test entities with customizable properties
- **Factory Composition**: Support for creating complex entity relationships
- **Consistent Entity States**: Standard states for entities (e.g., draft, published, archived)
- **Randomized Data Generation**: Usage of faker libraries for realistic but varied test data

### Database Mocking Strategy

- **In-Memory Database Option**: SQLite in-memory database for unit tests requiring database interactions
- **Mock Database Responses**: Mocked database layer for pure unit tests
- **Database Proxying**: Recording and replaying database interactions for deterministic tests
- **Seeding Approach**: Consistent database seeding patterns for integration tests

### Test Data Lifecycle Management

- **Setup and Teardown Hooks**: Standardized hooks for test data preparation and cleanup
- **Data Isolation Between Tests**: Prevention of test data leaking between test cases
- **Snapshot Data Management**: Storing and restoring database snapshots for specific test scenarios
- **Seed Data Versioning**: Version control for seed data alongside code changes

### Special Testing Scenarios

- **Large Dataset Testing**: Strategies for testing with large volumes of data
- **Time-Sensitive Data**: Handling of date-dependent tests using time manipulation
- **Long-Running Processes**: Testing approach for background jobs and async processes
- **Cross-Database Operations**: Testing strategy for operations spanning multiple data sources

### Security Considerations for Test Data

- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Approaches for working with PII in test environments
- **Data Anonymization**: Techniques for masking sensitive information in test datasets
- **Test Credentials Management**: Secure storage and rotation of test credentials
- **Access Control Testing**: Verification of data access boundaries with varied user contexts

## Testing Standards Framework

- **Test Description Conventions**: BDD-style formatting guidelines
- **Test Naming Strategy**: Consistent naming convention approach
- **Documentation Requirements**: Test documentation standards
- **Review Process**: Test code review methodology
- **Coverage Requirements**: Minimum coverage thresholds by component type

## Resource Testing Architecture

- **Resource Operation Testing**: CRUD verification approach
- **Permission Testing**: Access control verification strategy
- **Validation Testing**: Input constraint verification methodology
- **Relationship Testing**: Resource association verification approach
