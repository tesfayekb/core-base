# User Management System

> **Version**: 1.1.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-05-22

## Overview

This document serves as the entry point for understanding the user management system implemented in the application. The system has been designed to support multi-tenant environments with role-based access control.

## Core Principles

The user management system is built on the following principles:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Authentication, identity, and profile data are logically separated
2. **Extensibility**: The core user model supports domain-specific extensions
3. **Security First**: All user operations enforce strict security controls
4. **Multi-tenant Awareness**: Users can exist across multiple tenants with different roles
5. **Audit Trail**: All significant user operations are logged for compliance

## Documentation Structure

The user management documentation is organized into these focused components:

- **[IDENTITY_ARCHITECTURE.md](IDENTITY_ARCHITECTURE.md)**: User identity components and data model
- **[AUTHENTICATION.md](AUTHENTICATION.md)**: Authentication methods and security features
- **[REGISTRATION_ONBOARDING.md](REGISTRATION_ONBOARDING.md)**: User registration and onboarding processes
- **[PROFILE_MANAGEMENT.md](PROFILE_MANAGEMENT.md)**: Profile components and update permissions
- **[RBAC_INTEGRATION.md](RBAC_INTEGRATION.md)**: Role assignment architecture and permission resolution
- **[MULTITENANCY_INTEGRATION.md](MULTITENANCY_INTEGRATION.md)**: Cross-tenant identity and extensions
- **[AUDIT_SECURITY.md](AUDIT_SECURITY.md)**: User operations audit and data security

## Key Integration Points

The user management system integrates with:

1. **RBAC System**: For role assignment and permission management
2. **Multitenancy System**: For tenant-specific user profiles and roles
3. **Audit System**: For comprehensive logging of user operations
4. **Security System**: For authentication and session management
