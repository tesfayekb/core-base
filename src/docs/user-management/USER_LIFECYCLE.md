> **Version**: 1.0.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-05-23

## Overview

This document details the complete user lifecycle management process, from creation to final purging of user data. It defines the states a user can be in, transitions between states, and the business rules governing these transitions.

## User Lifecycle States

### State Definitions

1. **Active**
   - Full system access according to assigned permissions
   - Authentication enabled
   - Profile visible within authorized scopes
   - Included in relevant searches and lookups
   - Receives notifications and communications

2. **Suspended**
   - Temporary access restriction
   - Authentication disabled
   - Profile remains visible but marked as suspended
   - Often time-bound with auto-reactivation date
   - Administrative action required for early reactivation
   - Used for temporary suspensions (security concerns, policy violations)

3. **Deactivated**
   - Long-term access restriction
   - Authentication permanently disabled
   - Profile visibility limited to administrators
   - User data retained in primary storage
   - Can be reactivated by administrative action
   - Used for employees on leave, contract pause, etc.

4. **Archived**
   - No system access possible
   - User completely removed from active system
   - Data moved to archive storage
   - Searchable only in archive context
   - Limited admin access to archived data
   - Used for compliance-required data retention

5. **Deleted** (Soft Delete)
   - User completely removed from system views
   - Core identity metadata retained
   - Personal data anonymized per privacy policy
   - Relationships to other entities severed or anonymized
   - Cannot be restored without special procedures
   - Used after contractual relationship ends

6. **Purged** (Hard Delete)
   - Complete removal of all user data
   - No recovery possible
   - Only minimal compliance metadata retained
   - Legal basis required for complete purging
   - Must comply with relevant data protection laws
   - Used after retention period expires or on demand (GDPR)
