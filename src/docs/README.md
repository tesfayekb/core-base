- **[DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md](DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md)**: High-level development phases and milestones

### Security and Access Control
- **[security/README.md](security/README.md)**: Security implementation details organized by area
- **[../RBAC_SYSTEM.md](../RBAC_SYSTEM.md)**: Role-based access control system details

## Documentation Structure

The project documentation follows a hierarchical structure:

- **Core documents** in the root directory provide high-level guidance
- **Specialized directories** contain detailed documentation for specific areas:
  - **[implementation/](implementation/README.md)**: Implementation plans by phase
  - **[security/](security/README.md)**: Security standards and implementation details
  - **[audit/](audit/README.md)**: Audit logging framework and components
  - **[mobile/](mobile/README.md)**: Mobile application strategy and features

## Documentation Relationships

These documents are designed to work together to provide a comprehensive overview of the project:

- Architecture documents define the overall structure
- Implementation documents provide the execution plan
- Security documents outline protection mechanisms
- Testing documents ensure quality and reliability

Each document contains cross-references to related documents to help navigate the complete documentation set.

## Getting Started

For new team members, we recommend starting with these documents:

1. Start with [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md) for terminology standardization
2. Continue with [CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md](CORE_ARCHITECTURE.md) for system overview
3. Review [DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md](DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md) for project timeline
4. Explore [implementation/README.md](implementation/README.md) for detailed work breakdown
5. Reference specific documents as needed for your area of work
