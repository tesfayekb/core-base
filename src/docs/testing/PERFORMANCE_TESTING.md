# Performance Testing Strategy

> **Version**: 1.0.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-05-22

This document outlines the performance testing approach to ensure the application meets performance standards defined in [../PERFORMANCE_STANDARDS.md](../PERFORMANCE_STANDARDS.md).

## Performance Testing Types

### Load Testing
- Gradually increasing user load
- Steady state performance measurement
- System behavior under expected load
- Resource utilization analysis
- Database query performance

### Stress Testing
- System behavior at and beyond capacity
- Breaking point identification
- Degradation patterns analysis
- Recovery testing after overload
- Resource exhaustion scenarios

### Endurance Testing
- Long-duration performance stability
- Memory leak detection
- Resource consumption over time
- System stability under sustained load
- Database growth impact assessment

### Spike Testing
- Sudden load increase handling
- Rapid scaling capability testing
- Recovery from traffic spikes
- Auto-scaling effectiveness
- Resource allocation efficiency

## Performance Metrics

### Frontend Metrics
- First Contentful Paint (FCP) < 1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5s
- First Input Delay (FID) < 100ms
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1
- Time to Interactive (TTI) < 3.5s
- Total Blocking Time (TBT) < 200ms

### API Performance Metrics
- Response time percentiles (p50, p90, p99)
- Request throughput (requests/second)
- Error rate under load
- Connection overhead
- Time to First Byte (TTFB)

### Database Performance Metrics
- Query execution time
- Transaction throughput
- Connection pool utilization
- Index efficiency
- Query plan optimization
- Multi-tenant query isolation

### Resource Utilization Metrics
- CPU utilization patterns
- Memory consumption
- Network I/O
- Disk I/O
- Connection pooling efficiency

## Multi-Tenant Performance Considerations

- Per-tenant performance isolation
- Cross-tenant impact analysis
- Tenant-specific load patterns
- Noisy neighbor detection
- Resource allocation fairness

## Performance Test Environment

- Production-like test environment
- Data volume representativeness
- Infrastructure configuration parity
- Network conditions simulation
- Third-party service simulation

## Integration with Development Lifecycle

- Continuous performance testing
- Performance regression detection
- Performance budgets enforcement
- Pre-release performance validation
- Performance monitoring correlation

## RBAC Performance Testing

Specific testing for RBAC performance, implementing strategies from [../rbac/PERMISSION_QUERY_OPTIMIZATION.md](../rbac/PERMISSION_QUERY_OPTIMIZATION.md):

- Permission resolution latency
- Caching effectiveness
- Permission check throughput
- Role management operation performance
- Entity boundary enforcement overhead
