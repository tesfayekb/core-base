# Performance Testing Strategy

> **Version**: 1.1.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-05-23

This document outlines the performance testing approach to ensure the application meets performance standards defined in [../PERFORMANCE_STANDARDS.md](../PERFORMANCE_STANDARDS.md).

## Performance Testing Types

### Load Testing
- Gradually increasing user load
- Steady state performance measurement
- System behavior under expected load
- Resource utilization analysis
- Database query performance

### Stress Testing
- System behavior at and beyond capacity
- Breaking point identification
- Degradation patterns analysis
- Recovery testing after overload
- Resource exhaustion scenarios

### Endurance Testing
- Long-duration performance stability
- Memory leak detection
- Resource consumption over time
- System stability under sustained load
- Database growth impact assessment

### Spike Testing
- Sudden load increase handling
- Rapid scaling capability testing
- Recovery from traffic spikes
- Auto-scaling effectiveness
- Resource allocation efficiency

## Performance Metrics Implementation

### Frontend Performance Testing

Based on the standards defined in [../PERFORMANCE_STANDARDS.md](../PERFORMANCE_STANDARDS.md), we implement automated testing for:

**Core Web Vitals Testing:**
- First Contentful Paint (FCP) target: < 1.2s
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) target: < 2.0s
- First Input Delay (FID) target: < 50ms
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) target: < 0.1
- Time to Interactive (TTI) target: < 2.5s
- Total Blocking Time (TBT) target: < 150ms

**Application-Specific Metrics:**
- Dashboard load time target: < 2s
- Table rendering performance: < 300ms for 100 rows
- Form submission responsiveness: < 100ms
- Navigation performance: < 500ms between pages

### API Performance Testing

**Response Time Validation:**
- Authentication endpoints: < 200ms target
- CRUD operations: < 250ms for simple, < 500ms for complex
- Search endpoints: < 400ms target
- Report generation: < 2s target

**Throughput Testing:**
- Target: > 500 RPS per server
- Error rate threshold: < 0.1%
- 5xx error rate: < 0.01%
- API availability: > 99.9%

### Database Performance Testing

**Query Performance Validation:**
- Simple SELECT queries: < 10ms target
- Complex JOINs (2-3 tables): < 50ms target
- Permission resolution: < 15ms target
- Audit log insertion: < 5ms target

**Multi-Tenant Query Testing:**
- Tenant-filtered queries: < 15ms target
- Tenant switching: < 100ms target
- Cross-tenant operations: < 500ms target

## Multi-Tenant Performance Considerations

- Per-tenant performance isolation verification
- Cross-tenant impact analysis during load testing
- Tenant-specific load patterns simulation
- Noisy neighbor detection and prevention testing
- Resource allocation fairness validation

## Performance Test Environment

- Production-like test environment configuration
- Data volume representativeness matching performance standards
- Infrastructure configuration parity
- Network conditions simulation
- Third-party service simulation with realistic response times

## Integration with Development Lifecycle

- Continuous performance testing with benchmark validation
- Performance regression detection against defined standards
- Performance budgets enforcement based on documented KPIs
- Pre-release performance validation
- Performance monitoring correlation with test results

## RBAC Performance Testing

Specific testing for RBAC performance, implementing strategies from [../rbac/permission-resolution/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md](../rbac/permission-resolution/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md):

**Permission Resolution Testing:**
- Single permission check: < 5ms target
- Bulk permission checks: < 25ms for 20 items
- Cache hit rate validation: > 95% target
- Cross-tenant permission checks: < 10ms target

## Performance Test Automation

### Automated Performance Validation

```typescript
// Example performance test configuration
const performanceThresholds = {
  // Based on PERFORMANCE_STANDARDS.md
  coreWebVitals: {
    fcp: 1200, // 1.2s in milliseconds
    lcp: 2000, // 2.0s
    fid: 50,   // 50ms
    cls: 0.1,  // 0.1 score
    tti: 2500, // 2.5s
    tbt: 150   // 150ms
  },
  apiResponse: {
    authentication: 200,
    crudSimple: 250,
    crudComplex: 500,
    search: 400,
    reports: 2000
  },
  database: {
    simpleSelect: 10,
    complexJoin: 50,
    permissionCheck: 15,
    auditInsert: 5
  }
};
```

### Performance Monitoring Integration

- Real-time performance metrics collection (every 10 seconds)
- Automated alert generation when thresholds are exceeded
- Performance trend analysis and reporting
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline for performance gates

## Performance Test Scenarios

### Standard Load Test Scenarios

1. **Baseline Performance Test**
   - Single user scenarios validating target performance
   - All operations must meet target thresholds

2. **Normal Load Test**
   - Expected concurrent user load
   - All metrics must remain in target range

3. **Peak Load Test**
   - 2x normal load simulation
   - All metrics must remain in acceptable range

4. **Stress Test**
   - 5x normal load until system saturation
   - Graceful degradation validation

5. **Endurance Test**
   - 24-hour sustained load testing
   - < 5% variance from baseline performance
