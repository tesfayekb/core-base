# Component Architecture Guidelines

> **Version**: 2.0.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-05-23

## Overview

This document provides an overview of component architecture guidelines, including composition patterns, TypeScript interfaces, and integration with system features.

## Architecture Areas

The component architecture documentation is organized into focused areas for better maintainability:

### Design Patterns
- **[architecture/COMPOSITION_PATTERNS.md](architecture/COMPOSITION_PATTERNS.md)**: Comprehensive composition strategies, compound components, and reusable design patterns

### TypeScript Implementation
- **[architecture/TYPESCRIPT_INTERFACES.md](architecture/TYPESCRIPT_INTERFACES.md)**: Props interface design standards, generic component patterns, and type safety guidelines

### State Management
- **[architecture/STATE_MANAGEMENT.md](architecture/STATE_MANAGEMENT.md)**: Local state management, context patterns, and integration with external state

### System Integration
- **[architecture/INTEGRATION_PATTERNS.md](architecture/INTEGRATION_PATTERNS.md)**: Permission-based rendering, tenant-aware components, and error boundary implementation

## Core Design Principles

### Composition over Inheritance
Components are designed for composition rather than inheritance, enabling flexible and reusable component hierarchies.

### Type Safety
Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety and provide excellent developer experience with proper IntelliSense support.

### Performance Optimization
Component architecture includes built-in performance optimizations through proper memoization, lazy loading, and efficient rendering strategies.

### Accessibility First
All components include accessibility features by default, supporting screen readers, keyboard navigation, and WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.

## Integration Points

Component architecture integrates seamlessly with:
- **RBAC System**: Permission-aware rendering and access control
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Tenant-aware styling and functionality
- **Security**: Input validation and output sanitization
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering and resource management
