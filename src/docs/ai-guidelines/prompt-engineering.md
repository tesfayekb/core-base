# AI Prompt Engineering Guidelines

When interacting with AI tools for this project, follow these guidelines to get the best results:

## Effective Prompts

- Be specific about the requirements
- Reference existing components and patterns
- Specify file paths and names when requesting new code
- Include expected props and functionality
- Mention any edge cases to handle

## Example Prompt Structure

```
Create a [component name] component that [describes functionality].
It should:
- Accept these props: [list props with types]
- Handle these scenarios: [list scenarios]
- Match the design style of [reference component]
- Be located at [file path]
```

## Iterative Development

- Start with a minimal implementation
- Request specific improvements in subsequent prompts
- Ask for explanations of complex code sections
- Verify the code meets requirements before moving forward
