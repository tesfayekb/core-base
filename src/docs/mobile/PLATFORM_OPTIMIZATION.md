> **Version**: 3.0.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-05-23

## Overview

This document provides an overview of platform-specific optimization strategies for mobile applications. For detailed implementation guidance, see the platform-specific documents below.

## Platform-Specific Guides

### iOS Platform
- **[iOS Optimization](platform/IOS_OPTIMIZATION.md)**: Safari performance, PWA configuration, and memory management
- Key focus: Viewport handling, touch events, and iOS-specific PWA features

### Android Platform
- **[Android Optimization](platform/ANDROID_OPTIMIZATION.md)**: Chrome performance, Material Design, and battery optimization
- Key focus: Input handling, Trusted Web Activity, and power management

### Cross-Platform
- **[Cross-Platform Optimization](platform/CROSS_PLATFORM.md)**: Shared strategies for asset, network, and device optimization
- Key focus: Universal performance patterns and device capability detection
