## Disaster Recovery Planning

### Disaster Recovery Strategy

**Multi-Region Architecture:**

   - Automatic traffic redirection
   - Data synchronization validation
   - Service restoration verification

2. **Manual Failover**
   - Emergency procedure activation
   - Management team coordination
   - Stakeholder notification
   - Recovery plan execution

### Business Continuity

**Service Level Objectives:**
- System availability: 99.9% uptime
- Maximum downtime: 8.76 hours/year
- Recovery time: 1-4 hours
- Data loss: Maximum 5 minutes

**Communication Procedures:**
- Automated status page updates
- Customer notification system
- Stakeholder communication plan
- Media response coordination

### Testing and Validation

**Regular Testing Schedule:**
- Monthly recovery testing
- Quarterly disaster recovery drills
- Annual comprehensive testing
- Ad-hoc scenario testing

**Test Scenarios:**
- Single tenant recovery
- Multiple tenant recovery
- Complete system recovery
- Cross-region failover
