# UI Standards

> **Version**: 1.1.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-05-23

This document outlines the UI design system and implementation standards for the project.

## Design Principles

### Consistency
- Unified design language across all components
- Consistent spacing and sizing systems
- Standardized color palette and semantic meanings
- Comprehensive typography system with proper scales

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance implementation
- Keyboard navigation patterns and focus management
- Screen reader support with proper ARIA attributes
- Sufficient color contrast ratios across all themes
- Comprehensive focus management strategies

### Responsiveness
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- Fluid layouts with proper breakpoint strategies
- Device-specific optimizations and touch targets
- Consistent experience across all device sizes

### Performance
- Optimized component rendering with React best practices
- Minimized layout shifts through proper sizing
- Efficient CSS implementation using Tailwind
- Image optimization and lazy loading strategies

## Component Library

Based on shadcn/ui with project-specific extensions and comprehensive implementation:

### Core Components
- Button variants with proper interaction states
- Input components with validation feedback
- Card layouts with consistent spacing
- Navigation elements with accessibility support
- Form components with error handling

### Extended Components
- Dashboard-specific components with data visualization
- Permission-aware components for RBAC integration
- Tenant-aware components for multi-tenant support
- Custom interaction patterns for complex workflows
- Application-specific business logic components

## Comprehensive Documentation

## Integration with System Features

### Permission-Based Rendering
Components integrate seamlessly with the RBAC system for permission-aware rendering:

```typescript
<PermissionBoundary action="Update" resource="users" resourceId={user.id}>
  <EditButton onClick={() => editUser(user.id)} />
</PermissionBoundary>
```

### Multi-Tenant Support
UI components support tenant-aware styling and functionality:

```typescript
<TenantAwareComponent>
  <DashboardContent />
</TenantAwareComponent>
```

### Security Integration
All UI components follow security best practices for input validation and output sanitization.

## Implementation Standards

### Component Architecture
- Composition over inheritance patterns
- Prop-based configuration with TypeScript
- Controlled components with proper state management
- Built-in accessibility support

### CSS Approach
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- CSS variables for theming and customization
- Component-specific styles when needed
- BEM methodology for custom class naming

### Responsive Implementation
- Mobile-first breakpoint strategy
- Fluid typography and spacing
- Responsive container queries
- Adaptive component layouts

## Security Considerations

UI components implement security measures including:
- Input sanitization and validation
- XSS prevention in dynamic content
- Secure theme customization (see [security/THEME_SECURITY.md](security/THEME_SECURITY.md))
- Permission-based access controls
