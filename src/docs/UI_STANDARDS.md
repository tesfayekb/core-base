# UI Standards

This document outlines the UI design system and implementation standards for the project.

## Design Principles

### Consistency
- Unified design language across all components
- Consistent spacing and sizing
- Standardized color palette
- Typography system

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- Sufficient color contrast
- Focus management

### Responsiveness
- Mobile-first approach
- Fluid layouts
- Device-specific optimizations
- Consistent experience across devices

### Performance
- Optimized component rendering
- Minimized layout shifts
- Efficient CSS
- Image optimization

## Component Library

Based on shadcn/ui with project-specific extensions:

### Core Components
- Buttons and inputs
- Cards and containers
- Navigation elements
- Form components
- Data display components

### Extended Components
- Dashboard-specific components
- Data visualization elements
- Custom interaction patterns
- Application-specific components

## Theming System

### Color System
- Primary, secondary, accent colors
- Neutral palette
- Semantic colors (success, warning, error, info)
- Light and dark mode variants

### Typography
- Font families (sans-serif, monospace)
- Type scale (heading levels, body text)
- Font weights
- Line heights and letter spacing

### Spacing
- 4px base grid
- Standardized spacing scale
- Component-specific spacing rules

### Effects
- Shadows and elevation
- Animations and transitions
- Border styles
- Hover and focus states

## Implementation Standards

### Component Architecture
- Composition over inheritance
- Prop-based configuration
- Controlled components
- Accessibility built-in

### CSS Approach
- Tailwind CSS for utility styles
- Custom CSS for complex components
- CSS variables for theming
- BEM for custom class naming

### Responsive Implementation
- Mobile-first breakpoints
- Fluid typography
- Responsive container queries
- Adaptive layouts
