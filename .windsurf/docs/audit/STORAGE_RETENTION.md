# Log Storage & Retention

> **Version**: 1.1.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-05-23

## Security-Driven Retention Policies

- **Security logs**: 1-year minimum retention as specified in security documentation
- **Authentication logs**: 1-year retention for all authentication events
- **Authorization logs**: 1-year retention for all permission checks and access events
- **Other logs**: Retention periods as defined in logging standards

### Retention Categories

1. **Critical Security Events**: 1-3 years minimum (configurable)
2. **User Activity**: 6-12 months minimum
3. **System Operations**: 3-6 months minimum
4. **Diagnostic Information**: 1-3 months minimum

### Compliance-Specific Retention

| Regulation | Log Type | Retention Period | Notes |
|------------|----------|------------------|-------|
| SOC 2 | Security events | 1 year | Includes all authentication events |
| GDPR | User data access | 6 months | With PII protection |
| HIPAA | PHI access | 7 years | Special encryption required |
| PCI-DSS | Card data access | 1 year | Special isolation required |
| Internal | Business operations | 2 years | For business continuity |

## Secure Storage Implementation

- **Encryption** of log data at rest
- **Tamper-evident storage** using cryptographic verification
- **Secure backup and archival** procedures
- **Access controls** aligned with the RBAC system

### Storage Security Features

1. Column-level encryption for sensitive fields
2. Hash chain verification for log integrity
3. Backup encryption with separate key management
4. Read-only access for standard audit activities

## Archival Strategy

- **Time-based archiving** for older logs
- **Cold storage** for archived logs
- **Index preservation** for searchability
- **Compliance-driven retention** beyond standard periods

### Archival Process

1. Automated movement to archive tables/storage
2. Compressed storage format for efficiency
3. Metadata preservation for searchability
4. Legal hold capability for investigations

## Retention Enforcement

- **Automated purging** of expired logs
- **Selective field anonymization** after primary retention
- **Summarization** of statistical data for long-term analysis
- **Exception handling** for logs under investigation

### Purge Safeguards

1. Multi-level approval for manual purges
2. Retention extension for flagged events
3. Audit trail of retention policy changes
4. Automated verification of retention compliance

### Data Lifecycle Management

**Stage-Based Retention:**
1. **Active Stage**: Full data in primary storage (30-90 days)
2. **Warm Stage**: Accessible archived data (90-365 days)
3. **Cold Stage**: Compressed archival data (1-7 years)
4. **Purge Stage**: Data deletion or extreme anonymization

**Automated Migration Pipeline:**
```
Active Database → Warm Archive → Cold Archive → Selective Purge
```

## Log Retention Governance

- **Retention Policy Committee**: Cross-functional team reviews and approves policy changes
- **Annual Review**: Formal review of all retention periods
- **Exception Management**: Process for retention exceptions (legal, investigation)
- **Policy Documentation**: Version-controlled retention policy documentation

### Retention Monitoring

1. **Dashboard**: Retention status visualization
2. **Alerts**: Notification for retention violations
3. **Reporting**: Compliance reporting for retention adherence
4. **Audit**: Regular verification of retention policy implementation
