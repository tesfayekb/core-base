# Log Format Integration

> **Version**: 1.0.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-05-23

## Overview

This document details how the standardized log format integrates with other systems, including the audit system, performance considerations, and multi-tenant environments.

## Integration with Audit System

The standardized log format integrates with the audit system:

1. **Event Filtering**: Security and audit events are automatically filtered and sent to the audit system
2. **Format Transformation**: Logs are transformed into audit records with appropriate fields
3. **Compliance Tagging**: Logs are tagged for compliance requirements

## Performance Considerations

To maintain system performance while logging:

1. **Sampling**: Apply sampling for high-volume debug logs
2. **Batching**: Batch log writes to minimize I/O overhead
3. **Async Processing**: Use asynchronous logging for non-critical logs
4. **Selective Detail**: Include detailed data only at appropriate log levels

## Multi-Tenant Considerations

Logs in a multi-tenant environment must adhere to additional requirements:

1. **Tenant Isolation**: Logs must maintain tenant data isolation
2. **Tenant Context**: All logs must include tenant context when applicable
3. **Cross-Tenant Operations**: Cross-tenant events require additional audit detail
4. **Tenant-Specific Filtering**: Support filtering logs by tenant

```typescript
// Example of tenant-aware logging
function logWithTenantContext(
  logger: LoggingService, 
  tenantId: string,
  message: string,
  data?: Record<string, any>
): void {
  // Ensure tenant context is included
  const tenantLogger = logger.withContext({ tenantId });
  
  // Log with tenant context
  tenantLogger.info(message, data);
}
```

## Entity Boundary Enforcement

Security-related logs and access to log data must respect the entity boundaries defined in [../rbac/ENTITY_BOUNDARIES.md](../rbac/ENTITY_BOUNDARIES.md):

- All logs MUST include entity context when available
- Entity boundary checks MUST follow the canonical algorithm from ENTITY_BOUNDARIES.md
- Permission checks for log access MUST validate entity context

```typescript
// Entity boundary validation for log access
function validateLogAccess(user, entityId, tenantId) {
  // Use the canonical validation algorithm
  return validatePermissionGrant(
    user, 
    'ViewLogs', 
    { entityId, tenantId }
  );
}
```

## Error Handling Integration

Log format integration with error handling standards defined in [../security/ERROR_HANDLING.md](../security/ERROR_HANDLING.md):

1. **Error to Log Mapping**: 
   - Security errors generate corresponding log events
   - Error severity maps to appropriate log levels
   - Error correlation IDs preserved in logs

2. **Standardized Error Logging**:
   - Errors follow the standardized format
   - Error logs include all required context
   - Error patterns generate appropriate alerts

## Event Architecture Integration

Integration with the event architecture defined in [../integration/EVENT_ARCHITECTURE.md](../integration/EVENT_ARCHITECTURE.md):

1. **Event to Log Mapping**:
   - System events generate corresponding log entries
   - Event correlation IDs preserved in logs
   - Event context included in log context

2. **Log-Driven Events**:
   - Critical log entries trigger system events
   - Log patterns generate aggregated events
   - Security incidents derived from log analysis
