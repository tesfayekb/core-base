# Audit Logging Framework Overview

> **Version**: 1.0.2  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-05-18

The audit logging architecture provides comprehensive, tamper-evident logging across the application with minimal performance impact. This document outlines the high-level design decisions for the audit logging system.

## Core Objectives

The audit logging architecture aims to:

1. **Provide Comprehensive Traceability**: Track all significant system events
2. **Ensure Security Compliance**: Meet regulatory and security requirements
3. **Support Forensic Analysis**: Enable detailed investigation of incidents
4. **Minimize Performance Impact**: Efficient logging with minimal system overhead
5. **Protect Sensitive Information**: Apply appropriate data protection for logs

## Key Architectural Decisions

- **Log Format**: Standardized JSON structure for all log entries
- **Storage Mechanism**: Tamper-evident database with cryptographic verification chain
- **Categorization System**: Hierarchical categorization by severity and event type
- **Context Framework**: Standardized approach for capturing action context
- **Access Control**: Role-based access with granular permissions
- **Performance Strategy**: Asynchronous processing with guaranteed delivery

## Integration Architecture

The audit logging framework integrates with:

1. **Security System**: Event-based hooks for security-relevant events
2. **RBAC System**: Permission-based log access control
3. **User Management**: Identity verification and attribution
4. **Resource Framework**: Standardized resource operation tracking

## Comprehensive Log Categories

- **Security Events**: Authentication, authorization, security settings
- **User Activity**: Resource operations, preferences, profile changes
- **System Events**: Application lifecycle, configurations, deployments
- **Performance Events**: Resource usage, response times, errors

## Architectural Principles

The logging architecture follows these principles:

1. **Complete**: Capture all relevant information
2. **Consistent**: Use standardized formats and fields
3. **Contextual**: Include sufficient context for understanding
4. **Compact**: Optimize for storage efficiency
5. **Confidential**: Protect sensitive information
