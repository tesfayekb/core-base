# Deployment Strategy

> **Version**: 1.0.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-05-24

## Overview

Comprehensive deployment strategy ensuring zero-downtime deployments, automated rollbacks, and environment consistency across development, staging, and production environments.

## Deployment Architecture

### Environment Strategy

**Development Environment:**
- Local development with hot reload
- Feature branch deployments for testing
- Database migrations in isolated schema
- Mock external services

**Staging Environment:**
- Production-like configuration
- Full integration testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Security vulnerability scanning

**Production Environment:**
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Automated health checks
- Real-time monitoring
- Automated backup procedures

### Deployment Pipeline

**Stage 1: Code Quality (2-3 minutes)**
- TypeScript compilation
- ESLint and Prettier validation
- Unit test execution (100% pass required)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

**Stage 2: Integration Testing (5-10 minutes)**
- Database migration testing
- API integration tests
- RBAC permission validation
- Multi-tenant isolation tests

**Stage 3: Security Validation (3-5 minutes)**
- Security policy validation
- Input validation testing
- Authentication/authorization tests
- Audit logging verification

**Stage 4: Performance Validation (10-15 minutes)**
- Load testing against benchmarks
- Database query performance validation
- Memory and CPU usage profiling
- Response time verification

**Stage 5: Deployment (5-10 minutes)**
- Blue-green environment switch
- Database migration execution
- Cache warming procedures
- Health check validation

## Zero-Downtime Deployment Process

### Blue-Green Deployment

**Blue Environment (Current Production):**
- Serves live traffic
- Maintains current application version
- Monitors for performance issues
- Ready for immediate rollback

**Green Environment (New Version):**
- Receives new deployment
- Undergoes comprehensive testing
- Database migrations applied
- Health checks validated

**Traffic Switch Process:**
1. Deploy to green environment
2. Run automated validation suite
3. Perform gradual traffic shifting (10%, 25%, 50%, 100%)
4. Monitor key metrics during shift
5. Complete switch or trigger rollback

### Database Migration Strategy

**Migration Types:**
- **Additive Changes**: New tables, columns, indexes (safe)
- **Destructive Changes**: Dropping columns, tables (requires coordination)
- **Data Migrations**: Large data transformations (staged approach)

**Migration Process:**
1. **Pre-deployment**: Additive schema changes
2. **Application Deployment**: Code that works with both old and new schema
3. **Post-deployment**: Remove old schema elements
4. **Validation**: Verify data integrity

## Environment Configuration Management

### Configuration Strategy

**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# Database Configuration
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
DATABASE_POOL_SIZE=20
DATABASE_TIMEOUT=30000

# Security Configuration
JWT_SECRET=...
ENCRYPTION_KEY=...
SESSION_TIMEOUT=3600

# Multi-tenant Configuration
TENANT_ISOLATION_LEVEL=strict
MAX_TENANTS_PER_INSTANCE=1000

# Performance Configuration
CACHE_TTL=300
RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS=1000
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=60000

# Monitoring Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=info
METRICS_ENABLED=true
AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS=365
```

**Configuration Validation:**
- Environment-specific validation rules
- Required configuration checks
- Configuration drift detection
- Secure configuration storage

### Service Configuration

**Application Configuration:**
- Feature flags for gradual rollouts
- A/B testing configuration
- Performance tuning parameters
- Security policy settings

**Infrastructure Configuration:**
- Load balancer settings
- Auto-scaling parameters
- Network security groups
- Backup and recovery settings

## Rollback Procedures

### Automated Rollback Triggers

**Performance Degradation:**
- Response time >500ms (95th percentile)
- Error rate >1%
- CPU/Memory usage >90%
- Database connection pool exhaustion

**Security Issues:**
- Authentication failure spike
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Data integrity violations
- Audit logging failures

**Business Logic Failures:**
- Critical feature failures
- Data corruption detection
- Integration service failures
- User experience degradation

### Rollback Process

**Immediate Rollback (< 2 minutes):**
1. Trigger blue-green environment switch
2. Revert load balancer to previous version
3. Restore previous application configuration
4. Validate system health

**Database Rollback (5-15 minutes):**
1. Execute pre-prepared rollback scripts
2. Restore database to previous migration state
3. Verify data integrity
4. Update application configuration

**Full System Rollback (15-30 minutes):**
1. Complete application rollback
2. Infrastructure configuration revert
3. Cache invalidation and warming
4. Comprehensive system validation

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Deployment Monitoring

**Real-time Metrics:**
- Application response times
- Error rates and types
- Database performance
- Resource utilization

**Business Metrics:**
- User session success rates
- Feature usage patterns
- Transaction completion rates
- Customer satisfaction indicators

### Alert Configuration

**Critical Alerts (Immediate Response):**
- System unavailability
- Security breaches
- Data corruption
- Performance degradation >50%

**Warning Alerts (30-minute Response):**
- Performance degradation 10-50%
- Increased error rates
- Resource utilization >80%
- Backup failure notifications

**Informational Alerts:**
- Successful deployments
- Configuration changes
- Scheduled maintenance
- Capacity planning triggers

## Environment Promotion

### Promotion Process

**Development → Staging:**
1. Feature branch merge to staging branch
2. Automated testing suite execution
3. Security vulnerability scanning
4. Performance baseline validation

**Staging → Production:**
1. Manual approval after staging validation
2. Production deployment window scheduling
3. Database migration dry-run execution
4. Rollback plan preparation

### Validation Checkpoints

**Pre-Promotion Validation:**
- All automated tests passing
- Security scan results reviewed
- Performance benchmarks met
- Documentation updated

**Post-Promotion Validation:**
- Health check validation
- Performance monitoring active
- Error rate monitoring
- User acceptance confirmation

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy

**Database Backups:**
- Daily full backups with 30-day retention
- Hourly incremental backups
- Point-in-time recovery capability
- Cross-region backup replication

**Application Backups:**
- Code repository with tag management
- Configuration backup and versioning
- Infrastructure as code backup
- Documentation and runbook backup

### Recovery Procedures

**Data Recovery:**
1. Identify recovery point objective (RPO)
2. Select appropriate backup version
3. Execute recovery procedures
4. Validate data integrity

**System Recovery:**
1. Infrastructure restoration
2. Application deployment
3. Database restoration
4. Configuration restoration
5. End-to-end validation
