| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|

| **Permission** | A specific authorization to perform an action on a resource. Permissions are grouped into roles. |
| **RBAC** | Role-Based Access Control - The security model that restricts system access based on roles assigned to users. |
| **SuperAdmin** | The highest-level role with complete access to all system features and resources. Cannot be deleted or modified. Has automatic access to all resources, including those created in the future. |
| **BasicUser** | The default role assigned to all new users, with limited permissions focused on personal data access. |
| **DepartmentAdmin** | An administrative role with permissions to manage resources within a specific department. |
| **Custom Role** | Any role created by administrators to group permissions for specific business needs. |
| **Permission Type** | A category of permission defining what kind of action is allowed (e.g., View, Create, Update, Delete). |

### Resources and Data

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Resource** | Any entity in the system that can be created, read, updated, or deleted and is subject to access control. Resources are the objects upon which permissions act. All resources follow the standardized Resource Definition Framework. |
| **Resource Type** | A category of resources that share the same structure and permission model (e.g., Users, Reports, Settings). |
| **Resource Framework** | The system that defines how resources are structured, validated, and interacted with. |
| **Resource Registry** | A centralized system that maintains information about all available resources and their metadata. |
| **Resource Operation** | An action that can be performed on a resource (e.g., create, read, update, delete). |
| **Resource Schema** | The structure that defines the fields, types, and validation rules for a resource. |
| **Resource URN** | Uniform Resource Name - A unique identifier for a resource that follows a standardized format. |

### Security and Authentication

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Authentication** | The process of verifying a user's identity. |
| **Authorization** | The process of determining whether a user has permission to perform a specific action. |
| **MFA** | Multi-Factor Authentication - A security system requiring more than one method of authentication. |
| **JWT** | JSON Web Token - A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. |
| **Session** | A period of interaction between a user and the application, maintained across multiple requests. |
| **RLS** | Row-Level Security - Database feature that restricts which rows a user can access in a database table. |
| **CSP** | Content Security Policy - A browser feature to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). |

### Logging and Monitoring

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Audit Log** | A chronological record of system activities that allows for tracking and verification of operations. |
| **Security Event** | Any activity related to security, such as login attempts, permission changes, or access denials. |
| **Log Level** | The severity or importance assigned to a log entry (e.g., Info, Warning, Error, Critical). |
| **Log Category** | The classification of a log entry based on its source or purpose (e.g., Security, UserActivity, System, Performance). |
| **Tamper-Evident Logging** | Logging mechanism that can detect if log entries have been modified after creation. |

### Application Components

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Component** | A reusable UI element that forms part of the application interface. |
| **Service** | A module that provides specific functionality to other parts of the application, typically handling business logic or data operations. |
| **Hook** | A function that encapsulates reusable logic in functional components. |
| **Context** | A mechanism to share state across components without passing props through the component tree. |
| **Provider** | A component that makes data or functionality available to other components. |
| **Form System** | The framework for creating, validating, and processing user input forms. |
| **API Layer** | The interface through which the frontend communicates with backend services. |
| **Theme System** | The framework for customizing the visual appearance of the application. |

## Development Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Development Phase** | A distinct period in the development process with specific goals and deliverables. |
| **Implementation Plan** | The detailed strategy for developing and deploying features and components. |
| **Sprint** | A time-boxed development cycle, typically 1-2 weeks, with specific goals and deliverables. |
| **Milestone** | A significant point in development marking the completion of a phase or delivery of a major feature. |
| **Test Framework** | The structure and tools used to create and execute tests for the application. |
| **CI/CD** | Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment - The practice of automating the integration and deployment of code changes. |

## Testing Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Unit Test** | A test that verifies the functionality of a specific section of code in isolation. |
| **Integration Test** | A test that verifies the interaction between two or more components. |
| **E2E Test** | End-to-End Test - A test that verifies the functioning of the complete application flow. |
| **Test Coverage** | The measure of how much of the application code is executed during testing. |
| **Test Fixture** | A fixed state used as a baseline for running tests. |
| **Test Case** | A set of conditions under which a tester determines if a feature is working correctly. |

## Mobile-Specific Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **PWA** | Progressive Web App - A web application that uses modern web capabilities to deliver an app-like experience. |
| **Native App** | An application built specifically for a particular platform (e.g., iOS or Android). |
| **Responsive Design** | Design approach where layout changes based on the screen size and device capabilities. |
| **Device Fingerprinting** | The process of collecting information about a device for identification purposes. |
| **Biometric Authentication** | Authentication using physical characteristics (e.g., fingerprint, face recognition). |

## Version Control and Deployment

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Semantic Versioning** | A versioning scheme in the format MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, where each number has specific meaning. |
| **API Version** | A specific iteration of an API that maintains consistent behavior within its version number. |
| **Environment** | A setting where code runs, typically classified as development, testing, staging, or production. |
| **Deployment Pipeline** | The automated process for moving code from development to production. |
| **Feature Flag** | A technique that allows features to be enabled or disabled without code changes. |

## Regulatory Compliance

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **PII** | Personally Identifiable Information - Data that could identify an individual. |
| **Data Retention** | The policy determining how long data is kept before being deleted or archived. |
| **Data Minimization** | The practice of collecting only the data necessary for a specific purpose. |
| **Privacy by Design** | An approach that includes privacy considerations from the start of system design. |
| **Compliance Reporting** | Documentation and evidence demonstrating adherence to regulatory requirements. |

## Future Extension

This glossary will be maintained as the authoritative source of terminology for the project. As new terms are introduced, they should be added here to maintain a consistent vocabulary across all documentation.

Additional domain-specific terminology sections will be added as the project evolves to include:

- Business-specific terms
- Integration terminology
- Industry-standard compliance terms
- Client-facing terminology
