# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System

> **Version**: 2.5.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-05-22

## Important Notice

This document provides a high-level overview of the RBAC system. The detailed implementation documentation has been refactored into smaller, more focused documents. **Please refer to the RBAC documentation directory for comprehensive information**:

[RBAC Documentation Directory](rbac/README.md)

## System Overview

The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system implements a **direct permission assignment model** with the following key characteristics:

1. **Direct Assignment**: Permissions are explicitly assigned to roles without hierarchical inheritance
2. **Union-Based Resolution**: Users with multiple roles have the union of all permissions from their roles
3. **Explicit Permissions**: All permissions must be explicitly granted to roles
4. **Functional Dependencies**: While permissions are explicitly assigned, there are logical dependencies between permission types

This design choice was made to:
- Simplify permission management
- Provide clear permission audit trails
- Eliminate inheritance ambiguity
- Support multi-tenant deployment scenarios

## Core Documentation Structure

The RBAC documentation is organized into these focused documents:

### Core Architecture
- **[rbac/README.md](rbac/README.md)**: Entry point and system overview
- **[rbac/ROLE_ARCHITECTURE.md](rbac/ROLE_ARCHITECTURE.md)**: Role definition and structure
- **[rbac/PERMISSION_TYPES.md](rbac/PERMISSION_TYPES.md)**: Permission taxonomy and implementation
- **[rbac/PERMISSION_DEPENDENCIES.md](rbac/PERMISSION_DEPENDENCIES.md)**: Functional dependencies between permissions
- **[rbac/PERMISSION_RESOLUTION.md](rbac/PERMISSION_RESOLUTION.md)**: How permissions are resolved

### Technical Implementation
- **[rbac/ENTITY_BOUNDARIES.md](rbac/ENTITY_BOUNDARIES.md)**: Entity-level permission isolation
- **[rbac/CACHING_STRATEGY.md](rbac/CACHING_STRATEGY.md)**: Multi-level caching approach
- **[rbac/DATABASE_OPTIMIZATION.md](rbac/DATABASE_OPTIMIZATION.md)**: Database design and optimization
- **[rbac/PERMISSION_QUERY_OPTIMIZATION.md](rbac/PERMISSION_QUERY_OPTIMIZATION.md)**: Performance optimization for permission queries
- **[rbac/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md](rbac/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION.md)**: Performance techniques
- **[rbac/MONITORING_ANALYTICS.md](rbac/MONITORING_ANALYTICS.md)**: Monitoring and analytics

## Integration Points

The RBAC system integrates with several other system components:

1. **Authentication System**: 
   - Session data includes cached permissions
   - User context provides role information
   - See [security/AUTH_SYSTEM.md](security/AUTH_SYSTEM.md) for details

2. **Audit Framework**:
   - Permission changes are logged for compliance
   - Permission checks can trigger audit events
   - See [audit/SECURITY_INTEGRATION.md](audit/SECURITY_INTEGRATION.md) for details

3. **Multi-Tenant Architecture**:
   - Entity-specific role customization
   - Permission boundary enforcement
   - See [security/MULTI_TENANT_ROLES.md](security/MULTI_TENANT_ROLES.md) for details

## Performance Considerations

For optimal performance of the permission system, two key documents work together:

1. **[rbac/PERMISSION_DEPENDENCIES.md](rbac/PERMISSION_DEPENDENCIES.md)**: Defines logical relationships between permission types that affect how permission checks should be implemented
2. **[rbac/PERMISSION_QUERY_OPTIMIZATION.md](rbac/PERMISSION_QUERY_OPTIMIZATION.md)**: Provides concrete implementation strategies for efficient permission querying based on these dependencies

These documents should be used together when implementing permission checking logic to ensure both correctness and performance.

## Version Compatibility

This document is part of a coherent set of documentation. For compatible versions of related documents, please refer to the [VERSION_COMPATIBILITY.md](VERSION_COMPATIBILITY.md) file. This ensures you implement features using compatible versions of different subsystem documents.
