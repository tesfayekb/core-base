  - Controls verbosity and detail levels
  - Configures audit trail requirements

### Security Policy Configuration

- **Purpose**: Defines security settings across the application
- **Features**:
  - Authentication requirements
  - Password policies
  - Session management rules
  - Rate limiting settings
- **Integration Points**:
  - Used by authentication components
  - Applied in RBAC permission checks
  - Referenced for audit compliance

## Dependency Management

### Version Compatibility Matrix

Each component specifies compatible versions of dependencies:

| Component | Event Bus | Common Types | Context Provider | Validation |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|------------------|------------|
| Security  | ≥2.0.0    | ≥1.5.0       | ≥1.2.0           | ≥3.1.0     |
| RBAC      | ≥2.0.0    | ≥1.5.0       | ≥1.2.0           | ≥3.0.0     |
| Audit     | ≥2.1.0    | ≥1.5.0       | ≥1.3.0           | ≥3.0.0     |

### Upgrade Strategy

For dependency upgrades:

1. **Minor Version Updates**
   - Automatic updates allowed
   - Integration tests must pass
   - No approval required
   
2. **Major Version Updates**
   - Coordinated upgrades required
   - Impact assessment mandatory
   - Cross-team approval needed
   - Rollback plan documented
