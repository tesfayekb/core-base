## Canonical References

The following documents serve as canonical references that all other documents must refer to:

| Canonical Reference | Current Version | Authoritative For |
|---------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Event Architecture | 2.0.0 | All event-driven integration |
| Database Query Patterns | 1.0.0 | All multi-tenant database queries |
| Data Isolation | 1.0.0 | Tenant data isolation including user profile isolation |
| Entity Boundaries | 1.0.0 | Entity boundary implementation |
| Error Handling Standards | 1.0.0 | Standardized error handling across all components |
| Permission Dependencies | 1.0.0 | Logical relationships between permission types |
| Permission Query Optimization | 1.0.0 | Efficient permission querying |
| Core Algorithm | 1.0.0 | Permission resolution algorithm |

## Implementation Strategy

When implementing features that span multiple subsystems, ensure that you are referencing compatible versions of each document. For example:

- If implementing the RBAC system version 2.5.0, you must adhere to Permission Dependencies 1.0.0 and Permission Query Optimization 1.0.0
- If implementing Security features according to version 1.4.0, you must follow Error Handling 1.0.0
- If implementing Integration features according to version 2.0.0, you must follow Event Architecture 2.0.0

## Upgrading Components

When upgrading one component, check this matrix to determine which other components may need to be upgraded to maintain compatibility.

### Dependency Chains

The following chains represent important dependency relationships:

1. **Authentication Chain**:
   - Security Implementation 1.4.0 → RBAC 2.5.0 → Entity Boundaries 1.0.0

2. **Audit Chain**:
   - Audit Logging 1.1.0 → Log Format 1.0.0 → Security Events 1.0.0

3. **Multi-tenant Chain**:
   - Multitenancy 1.2.0 → Database Query Patterns 1.0.0 → Data Isolation 1.0.0

4. **Testing Chain**:
   - Testing Framework 1.0.0 → Integration Testing 1.0.0 → Component Integration Map 1.0.0
