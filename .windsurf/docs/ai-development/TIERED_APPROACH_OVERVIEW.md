## Overview

This document establishes a three-tiered approach to documentation that optimizes AI developer experience and reduces cognitive load.

## Tier Structure

### Tier 1: Quick Start (Essential)
**Target**: Get running in 1-2 hours
**Documents**: 5-7 essential files
**Focus**: Minimum viable implementation

- Core patterns only
- Essential database setup
- Basic authentication
- Simple permission checks
- One-tenant setup

### Tier 2: Standard (Complete)
**Target**: Production-ready in 2-4 weeks
**Documents**: 15-20 comprehensive files
**Focus**: Full-featured implementation

- Multi-tenant architecture
- Complete RBAC system
- Audit logging
- Security hardening
- Performance optimization

### Tier 3: Advanced (Specialized)
**Target**: Complex scenarios and customization
**Documents**: 30+ detailed specifications
**Focus**: Edge cases and optimization

- Performance tuning
- Custom integrations
- Advanced security
- Specialized patterns
- Troubleshooting guides

## AI Implementation Benefits

### Context Management
- **Tier 1**: Single session implementation possible
- **Tier 2**: Structured across 3-4 focused sessions
- **Tier 3**: Reference-only, consulted as needed

### Learning Curve
- **Progressive Complexity**: Each tier builds on previous
- **Clear Boundaries**: Know when to move to next tier
- **Focused Scope**: Prevent feature creep during implementation

### Implementation Speed
- **Quick Wins**: Tier 1 provides immediate results
- **Structured Progress**: Clear path from basic to advanced
- **Reduced Rework**: Tier structure prevents over-engineering

## Tier Navigation Rules

1. **Always start with Tier 1** unless explicitly advanced requirements
2. **Complete current tier** before moving to next
3. **Reference higher tiers** only when specific needs arise
4. **Validate tier completion** before progression
