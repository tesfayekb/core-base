### Enhanced Multi-Tenant Features
- **Document**: `multitenancy/DATABASE_QUERY_PATTERNS.md`
- **Focus**: Optimized tenant-aware queries
- **Target**: Query performance within acceptable limits
- **Validation**: All queries properly isolated

### User Management System
- **Document**: `user-management/RBAC_INTEGRATION.md`
- **Focus**: User CRUD with permission enforcement
- **Target**: Full user lifecycle operational
- **Validation**: All user operations secured

### Enhanced Audit Logging
- **Document**: `audit/LOG_FORMAT_STANDARDIZATION.md`
- **Focus**: Standardized audit events
- **Target**: All user actions logged consistently
- **Validation**: Audit trail complete and searchable

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 9-12)

### Audit Dashboard
- **Document**: `audit/DASHBOARD.md`
- **Focus**: Real-time audit log visualization
- **Target**: Dashboard shows live audit data
- **Validation**: Real-time updates working

### Security Monitoring
- **Document**: `security/SECURITY_MONITORING.md`

- **Target**: Security audit passed
- **Validation**: Penetration testing completed

## Implementation Strategy

### Sequential Development
1. Complete one phase fully before starting the next
2. Validate all features before proceeding
3. Maintain backward compatibility throughout
4. Document any deviations from plan

### Quality Gates
- Each phase requires validation checkpoint
- Performance testing at each phase boundary
- Security review before production deployment
- User acceptance testing for UI components

## Resource Planning

### Phase 2 Requirements
- 4 developers for 4 weeks
- Focus on backend systems and APIs
- Limited UI work, mainly admin interfaces

### Phase 3 Requirements
- 3 developers for 4 weeks
- Focus on dashboards and monitoring
- Significant frontend development

### Phase 4 Requirements
- Full team for 4 weeks
- Focus on polish and production readiness
- Extensive testing and validation

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- Performance degradation with scale
- Integration issues between components
- Security vulnerabilities in custom code

### Mitigation Strategies
- Continuous performance monitoring
- Regular integration testing
- Security code reviews at each phase

This guide provides detailed roadmap for development beyond the initial foundation.
