> **Version**: 2.0.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-05-23

## Overview

This guide provides the essential 4-week implementation path for AI development, focusing on the minimum viable features needed to get started.

## Core Implementation Path

### Week 1-2: Foundation
1. **Database Setup**: Reference `data-model/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`
   - Implement: user, role, permission, tenant, audit tables
   - Success: All tables created with proper relationships

2. **Authentication**: Reference `security/AUTH_SYSTEM.md`
   - Implement: JWT-based auth with session management
   - Success: Users can register, login, logout securely

### Week 3: RBAC Foundation
3. **Basic Roles**: Reference `rbac/ROLE_ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - Implement: SuperAdmin, TenantAdmin, BasicUser roles only
   - Success: Role assignment and permission checks working

4. **Direct Permissions**: Reference `rbac/PERMISSION_TYPES.md`
   - Implement: Direct permission assignment (no hierarchy)
   - Success: Permission checks return correct true/false results

### Week 4: Multi-Tenant + Security
5. **Data Isolation**: Reference `multitenancy/DATA_ISOLATION.md`
   - Implement: All queries include tenant_id filter
   - Success: Complete tenant data separation verified

6. **Input Validation**: Reference `security/INPUT_VALIDATION.md`
   - Implement: Sanitize all user inputs
   - Success: No XSS or injection vulnerabilities

## Essential Validation Checkpoints

### Foundation Complete (Week 2)
- [ ] Database schema matches documentation
- [ ] Authentication flow working end-to-end
- [ ] Session management operational

### RBAC Complete (Week 3)
- [ ] Three basic roles implemented
- [ ] Permission checks under 50ms
- [ ] Role assignment working

### Multi-Tenant Complete (Week 4)
- [ ] Tenant data completely isolated
- [ ] All inputs validated and sanitized
- [ ] Basic audit logging operational

## Next Steps

After completing this 4-week foundation:
- Reference `PHASE_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDES.md` for advanced features
- Use `CORE_PATTERNS.md` for standard implementation patterns
- Check `VALIDATION_CHECKLISTS.md` for detailed testing

## Quick Reference Links

- **Database**: `data-model/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`
- **Auth**: `security/AUTH_SYSTEM.md`
- **RBAC**: `rbac/ROLE_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- **Multi-tenant**: `multitenancy/DATA_ISOLATION.md`
- **Security**: `security/INPUT_VALIDATION.md`

## Success Metrics

- **Week 2**: Foundation working, basic auth operational
- **Week 3**: RBAC implemented, permissions working
- **Week 4**: Multi-tenant isolation complete, security hardened

This quick start provides everything needed to begin development without overwhelming detail.
