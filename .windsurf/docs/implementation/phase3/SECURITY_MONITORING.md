# Phase 3.2: Security Monitoring Implementation

> **Version**: 1.0.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-05-23

## Overview

This guide covers implementing real-time security monitoring including event detection, threat response workflows, and incident management. This integrates with the audit dashboard for comprehensive security oversight.

## Prerequisites

- Phase 3.1: Audit Dashboard operational
- Phase 2.3: Enhanced Audit Logging active
- Security infrastructure from Phase 1.5 functional

## Real-time Security Event Monitoring

### Security Event Detection
Following [../../security/SECURITY_MONITORING.md](../../security/SECURITY_MONITORING.md):

**Event Detection System:**
- Real-time security event monitoring and classification
- Anomaly detection algorithms for unusual patterns
- Threat correlation and analysis engine
- Automated threat severity assessment

**Security Event Types:**
- Authentication failures and brute force attempts
- Unauthorized access attempts and privilege escalation
- Suspicious data access patterns
- System configuration changes and security violations

**Testing Requirements:**
- Test security event detection accuracy
- Verify real-time monitoring performance
- Test anomaly detection algorithms
- Validate threat severity assessment

## Threat Response Workflows

### Incident Management System
Using [../../security/SECURITY_EVENTS.md](../../security/SECURITY_EVENTS.md):

**Response Automation:**
- Automated threat response workflows
- Incident escalation and notification systems
- Security incident tracking and management
- Response effectiveness measurement

**Workflow Components:**
- Threat detection triggers and thresholds
- Automated response actions (blocking, alerting)
- Manual intervention points for complex threats
- Incident resolution tracking and reporting

**Testing Requirements:**
- Test automated response workflow accuracy
- Verify incident escalation procedures
- Test notification system reliability
- Validate response effectiveness metrics

## Security Dashboard Implementation

### Comprehensive Security Overview
Following [../../security/SECURITY_MONITORING.md](../../security/SECURITY_MONITORING.md) dashboard requirements:

**Dashboard Features:**
- Real-time security status and threat levels
- Security event timeline and correlation views
- Threat response activity monitoring
- Security metrics and performance indicators

**Monitoring Capabilities:**
- Live security event streams
- Threat landscape visualization
- Security policy compliance monitoring
- Response team activity tracking

**Testing Requirements:**
- Test dashboard real-time updates
- Verify security metrics accuracy
- Test visualization component performance
- Validate compliance monitoring accuracy

## Integration with Audit System

### Unified Security and Audit View
- Security event correlation with audit logs
- Cross-system event analysis and reporting
- Unified incident timeline reconstruction
- Comprehensive security posture assessment

**Testing Requirements:**
- Test security-audit event correlation
- Verify unified timeline accuracy
- Test cross-system analysis functionality
- Validate security posture metrics

## Success Criteria

✅ Real-time security monitoring operational  
✅ Threat detection and response workflows functional  
✅ Security dashboard displaying accurate real-time data  
✅ Incident management system tracking and resolving threats  
✅ Integration with audit system providing unified view  
✅ Performance targets met for real-time monitoring
