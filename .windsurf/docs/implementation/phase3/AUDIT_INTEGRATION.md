# Phase 3: Advanced Audit Features Integration

> **Version**: 3.0.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-05-23

## Overview

This document provides implementation guidance for Phase 3 advanced audit features, including real-time monitoring, compliance reporting, and advanced analytics.

## Implementation Requirements

### Advanced Audit Features Implementation

Follow these specific Phase 3 audit requirements:

1. **Implement Event Correlation**
   - Request correlation ID tracking across events
   - User session tracking in audit events
   - Cross-system event correlation capability
   - Event timeline reconstruction features

2. **Add Real-Time Monitoring**
   - Security alert generation from patterns
   - Anomaly detection based on audit data
   - Real-time dashboard integration
   - Automated incident response triggers

3. **Enable Compliance Features**
   - Compliance reporting capabilities
   - Data retention policy enforcement
   - Audit trail integrity verification
   - Export capabilities for compliance audits

## Implementation Examples

### Event Correlation Example

```typescript
// Adding correlation IDs to audit events
const trackAuditEvent = (event: AuditEvent) => {
  // Get correlation ID from request context
  const correlationId = requestContext.getCorrelationId() || generateCorrelationId();
  
  // Add to event metadata
  return {
    ...event,
    metadata: {
      ...event.metadata,
      correlationId,
      sessionId: requestContext.getSessionId()
    }
  };
};
```

### Real-Time Monitoring Example

```typescript
// Setting up real-time alerting
const configureSecurityAlerts = () => {
  auditEventStream.subscribe(
    (event) => {
      // Check for security alert patterns
      if (isSecurityAlert(event)) {
        securityAlertService.triggerAlert({
          severity: calculateSeverity(event),
          source: event.source,
          details: event.data,
          timestamp: event.time
        });
      }
    }
  );
};
```

## Success Criteria

**Phase 3 Audit Integration Checklist:**

- [ ] Event correlation functionality operational
- [ ] Real-time monitoring integration functional
- [ ] Compliance reporting capabilities validated
- [ ] Audit trail integrity verification implemented
- [ ] Performance maintained under full audit feature load

**Validation Tests:**

1. Create a test that follows a request across multiple services
2. Verify security alerts trigger correctly on suspicious events
3. Generate compliance reports for standard regulations
4. Test export functionality with large datasets
