# Phase 2: Core Multi-Tenant Functionality

> **Version**: 4.0.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-05-23

## Overview

This phase builds core application functionality on the multi-tenant foundation established in Phase 1. All features are designed with multi-tenancy as a core assumption.

## Implementation Guides

Phase 2 is organized into 4 focused guides that build on multi-tenant foundations:

### [Phase 2.1: Advanced RBAC](phase2/ADVANCED_RBAC.md)
- **Enhanced for Multi-Tenancy**: Advanced permission resolution across tenant boundaries
- Multi-level caching with tenant awareness
- Permission dependencies within tenant contexts
- Performance optimization for multi-tenant environments

### [Phase 2.2: Enhanced Multi-Tenant Features](phase2/ENHANCED_MULTI_TENANT.md)
- **NEW**: Tenant management dashboard and administration
- **NEW**: Advanced tenant isolation strategies
- **NEW**: Tenant-specific customizations and branding
- **NEW**: Cross-tenant operations and data migration

### [Phase 2.3: Enhanced Audit Logging](phase2/ENHANCED_AUDIT_LOGGING.md)
- **Tenant-Aware**: Comprehensive audit system with tenant context
- Security event monitoring across tenant boundaries
- Compliance reporting per tenant
- Audit data isolation and retention policies

### [Phase 2.4: User Management System](phase2/USER_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM.md)
- **Multi-Tenant**: User provisioning across multiple tenants
- Tenant-specific user profiles and settings
- Cross-tenant user identity management
- Bulk operations with tenant awareness

## Complete Implementation Sequence

1. **Week 6**: Advanced RBAC with tenant optimization
2. **Week 7**: Enhanced Multi-Tenant Features  
3. **Week 8**: Enhanced Audit Logging with tenant context
4. **Week 9**: User Management System across tenants

## Success Criteria

At the end of Phase 2, the application should have:

1. **Advanced Multi-Tenant RBAC**: Complex permission scenarios across tenants
2. **Tenant Management**: Full tenant administration capabilities
3. **Comprehensive Audit**: Complete audit trail with tenant isolation
4. **User Management**: Cross-tenant user management with proper isolation
5. **Performance**: Optimized for multi-tenant scenarios
6. **Security**: Enhanced security with tenant boundaries

## Multi-Tenant Focus Areas

Phase 2 specifically addresses:

- **Tenant Administration**: Tools for managing multiple tenants
- **Cross-Tenant Operations**: Secure operations that span tenant boundaries
- **Tenant Isolation**: Advanced isolation strategies and verification
- **Performance**: Multi-tenant specific performance optimizations
- **Compliance**: Tenant-aware audit and compliance features

## Prerequisites

- Phase 1 completed with multi-tenant foundation operational
- Multi-tenant database schema active
- Tenant-aware authentication and RBAC functional
- Basic tenant isolation verified
