> **Version**: 1.0.0  
> **Last Updated**: 2025-05-22

This document outlines the comprehensive security testing approach for ensuring the application's security posture.

## Security Testing Categories

### Authentication Testing
- Credential validation testing
- Session management testing
- Authentication bypass testing
- Multi-factor authentication verification
- Password policy enforcement testing

### Authorization Testing
- Role-based access control validation
- Permission boundary testing
- Horizontal privilege escalation testing
- Vertical privilege escalation testing
- Resource access control testing
- Entity boundary enforcement testing

### Input Validation Testing
- Injection attack testing (SQL, NoSQL, LDAP, etc.)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) testing
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) testing
- Command injection testing
- Input sanitization verification
- File upload security testing

### Data Protection Testing
- Encryption implementation testing
- Sensitive data exposure testing
- Transport layer security testing
- Data at rest security testing
- Data leakage testing
- PII protection verification

### Multi-Tenant Security Testing
- Tenant isolation testing
- Cross-tenant access testing
- Shared infrastructure security testing
- Tenant-specific data protection testing
- For detailed multi-tenant testing, see [MULTI_TENANT_TESTING.md](MULTI_TENANT_TESTING.md)

## Testing Methodologies

### Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Code review for security vulnerabilities
- Static code analysis tools
- Security anti-pattern detection
- Secure coding standard compliance
- Dependency vulnerability scanning

### Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- Black-box security testing
- Vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing
- API security testing
- Security regression testing

### Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)
- Runtime vulnerability detection
- Real-time security feedback
- Instrumented security testing
- Context-aware security analysis

## Security Testing in CI/CD

- Security testing integration in build pipeline
- Automated security scans
- Security gate enforcement
- Vulnerability tracking and remediation
- Security regression prevention

## Reporting and Metrics

- Security test coverage metrics
- Vulnerability severity classification
- Time-to-fix measurements
- Security debt tracking
- Compliance reporting

## Integration with Error Handling and Audit

Security testing validates proper implementation of:
- Error handling standards ([../security/ERROR_HANDLING.md](../security/ERROR_HANDLING.md))
- Audit logging standardization ([../audit/LOG_FORMAT_STANDARDIZATION.md](../audit/LOG_FORMAT_STANDARDIZATION.md))
- Security event correlation
