## 📋 AI DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINES

**Before creating new code**:
1. Check this completion status
2. Review existing implementation in `src/`
3. Consult phase documentation in `src/docs/implementation/`
4. Verify component doesn't already exist

**For Phase 3 development**:
1. Focus only on Phase 3 requirements
2. Build upon existing Phase 1-2 infrastructure
3. Follow implementation guides in `src/docs/implementation/phase3/`
4. Test integration with existing systems
